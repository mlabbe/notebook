    # Compare Sets of Intervals #

    Given two sets of non-overlapping intervals sorted by starting point lowest to highest:
    
    $A = \{[i_{0},j_{0}], [i_{1},j_{1}], ...\}$, 
    $B = \{[k_{0},l_{0}], [k_{1},l_{1}], ...\}$

    find:
    
    1. the periods where $A$'s intervals do not overlap $B$'s intervals, and
    2. the periods where $B$'s intervals no not overlap $A$'s intervals
