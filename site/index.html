    # Mike's Viz Notebook # 

    [Mike's Viz Notebook](https://www.michaellabbe.com/notebook/)
    contains notes and interactive visualizations to help explore and
    understand concepts -- one per page.  My work is primarily focused
    on game development.

    Rather than be a full tutorial on each subject, the pages intend
    to be a supplement to one, helping explore concepts interactively.
    The excellent [Game Math](https://gamemath.com) book is a great
    starting point.

    I have started with the dot product because it is a
    well-understood, straightforward starting point while I get the
    core code for this site under my fingers.

    ## Future Intent ##

    I intend to expand this site on an as-needed basis for my own
    work, rather than produce a comprehensive, ordered set of
    visualizations that span all topics in a problem space.

    However, getting it right is important to me!  If there is an
    error, please send a pull request or write up an issue on the
    [official repo](https://github.com/mlabbe/notebook).
